# AntiRot
AntiRot is my personal take on a simple SHA256 file corruption checker. It scans directory trees and builds a JSON blob of SHA256 hashes for each file insideâ€”that's it.

Although I think the risk of bit rot and unexpected corruption are unlikely, I scared myself enough into building this for my ext4 storage devices. ZFS and btrfs weren't good immediate options for me to switch to.

There are a few great solutions out there to solve this problem already, such as [shatag](https://bitbucket.org/maugier/shatag), [cshatag](https://github.com/rfjakob/cshatag), and [chkbit](https://github.com/laktak/chkbit)...but none of them does quite what I want. I needed a solution that satisfied the following criteria:

* Executable on Synology's DSM, my NAS platform of choice, with minimal effort (i.e. cross-compiling) required
* Does not link OpenSSL
* Does not pollute directory structure or extended attributes

I chose Ruby because I already have [a Ruby interpreter on my Synology box](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/packages/Ruby). Ruby's standard libaries include directory traversal, digesting, and JSON parsing.

One notable difference between other tools and this one: AntiRot assumes that a file at a given path will never be changed. That solves the moving problem (a file moved is assumed not to be corrupt, instead simply a new file), as long as you run AntiRot frequently enough. If a file becomes corrupted, and is then moved, it won't be detected.

## Requirements
* Ruby (tested on Ruby 2.3.x and Ruby 2.4.x)

## Example usage/workflow
```$ ruby antirot.rb --store antirot_2019.json --scan /mnt/stuff```

The above command will scan /mnt/stuff and build a JSON blob of hashes from every file. It will store that in ```antirot_2019.json```. Subsequent runs of the same command will again scan /mnt/stuff, but compare each hash against what is already stored in the JSON blob.

If there are any mismatches, the tool will yell at you. Note that subsequent runs of the tool will NOT replace the stored SHA256. Currently, after repair, you will need to delete the json file and run antirot.rb over again.
